            <h1 class="pink">La Pascualita is so lifelike that People have been debating “Mannequin or Mummy” for 90 Years</h1>
                <h3>By Gina Dimuro ◊ Checked By John Kuroski ◊ August 11, 2018</h3>
            <p>Local legend holds that La Pascualita is the preserved corpse of the original shop owner's daughter, who died tragically on her wedding day.
                Embalmed corpses are not an unheard-of tourist attraction. Several popes are on view at the Vatican and visitors still flock to see Lenin’s preserved body in Moscow’s Red Square. Yet however macabre, these corpses serve something of a historical purpose. But that’s not quite the case with La Pascualita, a Mexican tourist attraction that has long had people wondering whether it’s a mannequin — or a corpse.
                <h2 class="pink">The Story Of La Pascualita</h2>
                La Pascualita is almost certainly more lifelike than any departmentstore mannequin you’ve ever seen. Not only is her face astonishingly expressive (complete with thick eyelashes and a glassy-eyed gaze), but her hands were constructed with painstaking detail and her legs even have varicose veins.
                In contrast to the blank, white mannequins that dominate shopping malls and whose only purpose is to show off the clothes they are dressed in, La Pascualita’s elaborate wedding dress is often only the second thing passerby will take note of, thanks to her eerily realistic features.
                People have indeed been taking note ever since La Pascualita first appeared in the window of a bridal store in Chihuahua, Mexico in 1930. The locals were supposedly immediately struck not only by the mannequin’s lifelike appearance but by the close resemblance she bore to the daughter of the shop owner, Pascuala Esparza.
                According to the story, the daughter was preparing to be married when she was tragically bitten by a black widow spider and succumbed to its poison on her wedding day. It wasn’t long after her death that the mannequin appeared in the shop window, giving birth to the legend that it was no mannequin at all, but the perfectly preserved body of the unlucky would-be bride.
                <!-- <img src="images/chihuahua-umbrellas.jpg" alt=""> -->
                <h2 class="pink">Mannequin Or Corpse?</h2>
                Over the years, customers have claimed that La Pascualita’s eyes follow them as they walk around the store, or that they have turned around to find her suddenly in a different position. Her presence is rumored to even unnerve some of the shop workers, with one claiming “Every time I go near Pascualita my hands break out in a sweat. Her hands are very realistic and she even has varicose veins on her legs. I believe she’s a real person.” Another local legend claims that La Pascualita is indeed just a mannequin, or at least started out that way. 
                According to this version of the story, a visiting French magician became so entranced by the bridal mannequin that he would visit her window each night and bring her to life, dancing with her and bringing her around town before returning her to the storefront each morning.
                Whatever her true origins, La Pascualita has become a local legend in her own right over the decades. The details of the mannequin’s origins are almost impossible to confirm and even the name “Pascuala Esparza” may have been an invention after the fact.
                It does seem improbable that an embalmed corpse could remain completely intact in the Mexican heat over the course of eight decades, but the current owner seems to know that La Pascualita is at least good for business. When asked for  he truth about the famous mannequin in his storefront he simply winked and replied, “Is it true? I really couldn’t say.”</p>

            <h1 class="pink">The Top Things to See and Do in Chihuahua, Mexico</h1>
            <h3>By Lauren Cocking ◊ August 17, 2021</h3>
            <p>Mexico’s largest state, Chihuahua, doesn’t have quite the flourishing tourist industry that nearby destinations such as Baja California enjoy. However, it is home to the world’s largest canyon system, the Barrancas del Cobre, as well as numerous museums and natural attractions. Here’s our pick of the top experiences around.
                <h2 class="pink">Take a ride on the El
                Chepe train </h2>
                As mentioned above, the Barrancas del Cobre – known as the Copper Canyon in English – is easily the biggest and best attraction in Chihuahua, and can be accessed via Mexico’s only commercial passenger train, El Chepe, which departs from Los Mochis in Sinaloa. Splurge for the first-class ticket so you can hop on and off at various stops along the route and take advantage of the canyons.
                <div class="quote-box"><p class="quote">“The Barrancas del Cobre – known as the Copper Canyon in English – is easily the biggest and best attraction in Chihuahua, and can be accessed via Mexico’s only commercial passenger train, El Chepe…”</p><img class="image-banner" src="images/chihuahua-train.jpg" alt=""></div>
                <h2 class="pink">Valle de los Monjes</h2>
                Valle de los Monjes is one of the Copper Canyon’s best attractions, and therefore, one of the coolest things to see in Chihuahua as a whole. Also known as the Valle de Bisabírachi, the Valley of the Monks contains a number of towering – up to 197ft (60m) tall! – natural sculptures, shaped by a combination of strong winds, sun and rain, as well as abrupt geological shifts. It’s known as the Valley of the Monks because some of the figures resemble monks.
                <h2 class="pink">Dunas de Samalayuca</h2>
                Sometimes people forget that Chihuahua is a vast desert state, but it is – and that means there are plenty of opportunities to venture out into the sand dunes while you’re in the area. The Dunas de Samalayuca are one of Chihuahua’s most underrated attractions, where adventure sports are all the rage – sandboarding, motocross and ATV activities are perhaps the most popular options. However, don’t even think about going in spring, summer or before the sun begins to set – it is a desert after all.
                <h2 class="pink">The Grutas de Coyame
                (Coyame Caves)</h2>
                Out in the Chihuahuan desert, some miles beyond the town of Coyame, you find this subterranean system crammed with awesome fangs of stalagmites and stalactites. Join a guided tour to discover how they were formed, and to learn more about the different rock formations and minerals that help make such a curious place.While you’re in the depths, take time to view the galleries of other formations, including aragonite like white coral, pale, shardlike selenite, and marble crystals you’ll wish you could take home for your shelves.
                <h2 class="pink">Visit the Palacio de Gobierno
                Building</h2>
                Commanding attention in the heart of Chihuahua, this ornate 19th-century building is one of the most notable architectural sights in Mexico. Evocative of a Baroque palazzo from Rome, it is celebrated for a shrine within, built in remembrance of the execution, in 1811, of Miguel Hidalgo, the Spanish Catholic priest who led the Mexican War of Independence. Whip out your smartphone to snap the central courtyard, resplendent with striking 1960s murals by Aarón Piña Mora, shedding light on Chihuahua’s tumultuous history with salutes to Abraham Lincoln and Simón Bolívar.
                <h2 class="pink">Poliforum de UACH
                University, Museum</h2>
                On imperious Plaza Hidalgo, where elegant palms sprout, you’ll see the University of Chihuahua museum. Here you’ll find two permanent displays of work by two prominent city artists: sculptor Águeda Lozano and Sebastián, famous for his ‘gate’ pieces, in concrete and steel. Explore also temporary exhibits of up-and-coming Mexican artists. If time allows, nose around the space where local and national artists’ works are regularly exhibited. Free guided tours are available until 3pm.
                <h2 class="pink">Cascadas de Cusárare</h2>
                In a hot climate such as Mexico’s, you won’t necessarily jump at the chance of hiking – but you’d be wrong to skip the short walk to the Cascadas de Cusárare, waterfalls plummeting for 98ft (30m). The attraction is considered one of the most impressive in the Sierra Tarahumara mountain range, and as a day trip it’s as easy on the legs as it is on the eye. Leaving the road for a 1.86mi (3km) trek cross country, you pass through a shaded pine forest past a bubbling stream, before finally emerging at this aquatic wonder, where you can jump in and cool off.
                <img class="image-banner" src="images/chihuahua-waterfall.jpg" alt="">
                <h2 class="pink">Creel and Lake Arareko</h2>
                A visit to Creel is all about getting to know the Rarámuri community of Chihuahua state. Their culture is captured in photographs on show at the Museo de la Casa de las Artesanías, moments from the train station. See also the Artesanías Misión, on the main square, which sells traditional Rarámuri crafts as a means of support for their local economy. While you’re here, make the 8.7mi (14km) drive south to Lake Arareko, a large U-shaped lake of transparent waters surrounded by fragrant coniferous forests and unusual rock formations, which can appear like sleeping animals. You can rent cabins and – bring your walking boots – hike in nature.
                <h2 class="pink">Cumbres de Majalca
                National Park</h2>
                Awe-inspiring rock formations are among the main attractions here, north of the city of Chihuahua. Shaped by millennia of wind and water erosion, they are prime territory – in fact one of the few places in the north – for spotting endangered species including the black bear. Among tranquil expanses of oak and pine forests, you can indulge your love of outdoor pursuits, hiking and mountain-biking. If you fancy staying a while in this magical wilderness, the Canyon of the Fairies is home to a camping area – with toilets.</p>
