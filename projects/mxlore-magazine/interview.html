            <h1>The Devil in Disguise?
                A personal account
                from my mother</h1>
                <h3>By Maria G. Garcia ◊ October 23rd, 2022
                </h3>
                    <p>Growing up, my mother would always share local legends from her native town of Simatel. Which is located an hour and a half away from Iguala City. Given the isolated location, people have reported strange things. This is one of those tales.
                        Some say he’s the devil, some say he’s a demon, others say he’s a spectral being. No one knows who he truly is, or what he wants. The man in black has been a cautionary tale shared for generations.
                        Me: Mom, do you remember the story you told me about the man in black?
                        Mom: Oh the one your great-great grandmother told me about! Of course I do.
                        Me: You never finished telling me, can you start over and tell me again?
                        Mom: I can. Let’s see...people in town used to say that they would encounter a man dressed in all black in the most remote areas. He always wore a luxurious suit and was often seen riding a black horse. It was very weird.
                        Me: Why was it weird?
                        Mom: Well no one in town could really afford luxury items, it’s a town of farmers. Also, it was strange how clean his clothes were. There’s nothing, but dirt roads out there. Even on horseback, you still kick up dust. 
                        However, the strangest thing about him was his physical appearance.
                        Me: What did he look like?
                        Mom: That’s the thing, he would present himself in different ways to people. To some people, he would appear as an old man. To others, he would present himself as a young handsome man. Some have said that instead of human feet, he has rooster feet.
                        Me: Eww that’s creepy. What would he do to people who encountered him? 
                        Mom: Well one lady did share her experience with him on her way to the market.
                        Back in the day, merchants would leave their homes at 3 or 4 in the morning and walk to their destination. It was a good idea to get to the market early enough to set up. And the closest market was a 4 hour walk away. There weren’t buses, or taxis that could take them there. So it wasn't unusual to see people walking on the dirt roads when it was still dark out.
                        This particular woman was on her way to sell firewood, when she came across an older man on horseback. He greeted her and asked where she was headed. She replied that she was headed to the market to sell her firewood. He offered her a ride so she wouldn’t have to walk all the way there. She rejected his offer and mentioned she didn’t want to trouble him. Also, what woman would go with a strange man?
                        Me: Haha that is true. Please continue!
                        Mom: Instead, the man offered to buy ALL the firewood she was carrying. He then proceeded to pull out solid gold coins from a satchel on his horse. The woman was shocked and once again rejected his offer. She said she possibly couldn’t accept that much money from him. The man simply smiled and insisted she accept the gold coins, so she could feed her family. 
                        The woman finally accepted and loaded the firewood on his horse. With that, the man thanked her and started to ride away, down the mountain slope. The woman waited for the man to leave and took a different path to get home. She told her husband about the man and showed him the money he gave her. The husband wanted to find the man to thank him, but the couple never saw him again.
                        Me: But if he’s the Devil, why did he gift her gold coins? I doubt he needed the firewood that badly.
                        Mom: Well the Devil can be sympathetic at times. But that doesn’t mean you should trust him. He's been known to kidnap pretty women.
                        Me: What? How?
                        Mom: He appears to them as a young handsome bachelor. Using his charm, he would convince young women to come back with him to his home. They would never be seen again.
                        People would often say they would see a young man in all black attend the town dances. Many parents warned their daughters to be careful of any man that approached them.
                        Me: What would he do with them?
                        Mom: Well some would say that he would kill them. Others said he would drag them to hell to become his bride. No one really knows. 
                        Some people say that he lives in the caves nearby and t0 stay away from that area.
                        Me: Do people still see him to this day?
                        Mom: Maybe, I'm not really sure. I know when
                        my great grandma told me this story, it scared me.
                        I avoided going out late at night. And any stranger
                        I came across.
                        Who knows if it’s true, or not?</p>
